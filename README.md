# Example of a conversation: Conversation between a patient and the Medical Assistant Chatbot.
JH:
Hello.

Medical Assistant Chatbot:
Hello! I'm the Medical Assistant Chatbot. What is your name?

JH:
My name is Johan.

Medical Assistant Chatbot:
Nice to meet you, Johan! How can I assist you today?

JH:
Im having having issues with my lower back

Medical Assistant Chatbot:
I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing lower back issues, Johan. Can you describe the symptoms you're having? For example, is the pain sharp or dull, and does it radiate to other parts of your body? When did the pain start?

JH:
It's just a steady pain in my lower back, i've been having it for a few days

Medical Assistant Chatbot:
I'm sorry to hear that. Have you had any recent physical activity or injury that might have contributed to this pain? Also, do you experience any numbness or tingling in your legs or buttocks?

JH:
I reacently fell over when i was painting, that's when the pain started.

Medical Assistant Chatbot:
It sounds like the fall might have caused some strain or injury to your lower back. Have you tried any remedies to alleviate the pain, such as rest, ice, or over-the-counter pain relievers?

JH:
No ice or pain relievers, just rest.

Medical Assistant Chatbot:
Rest is a good start. Applying ice can help reduce inflammation and numb the area, which might provide some relief. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can also help manage the pain. If the pain persists for more than a week or gets worse, it would be a good idea to see a doctor for a more thorough evaluation.
In the meantime, try to avoid any heavy lifting or activities that might aggravate your back. Gentle stretching and staying active within your comfort zone can also help. Does this sound manageable for you?

JH:
Yes thank you, this was good advice.

Medical Assistant Chatbot:
You're welcome, Johan. I'm glad I could help. If you have any more questions or if the pain doesn't improve, feel free to reach out again. Take care of yourself!

# Notes.
After working with the chatbot changing the temp from 0.5 to 0-7 i found a good place where the chatbot could give sufficent answers that wasent to long and was informative, I was aiming for the chatbot to always direct the chatter to seek professional help if the issue was to big, any issue that requierd medical care. In the case like the example i gave above he dident direkt me to medical care but gave adivce to relive the pain that i was having.
Other cases that i ran like broken bones he direkted me quickly to medical care.
